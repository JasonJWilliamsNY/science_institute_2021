In reality, the more senior a scientist you are the less time you spend doing experiments and the more time you spend writing. Why is writing essential for scientists? Your entire career depends upon: Your ability to clearly communicate your research results Your ability to convince prospective employers your work is important Your ability to convince those who fund your work (sometimes your employer, but more often government agencies and philanthropic foundations) that they should pay for your work to be done There are other reasons to be a good writer, but if you fail in the three areas above, your career will end before it starts. You've been misled In your life as a student, you have almost certainly been misled about writing. This has not been done purposely but as a symptom of standard education. By high school you have already done a fair amount of writing. By college graduation you may have written more essays than you will ever do later in life (unless you become a writer, or a scientist). Where does deception fit in? For most of your life as a writer, people (your teachers) have been paid to read your writing. That circumstance is opposite to how the real world works - unless you become a novelist and are successful enough that people pay you to read your writing. Your beautiful lab reports, flowing essays, and personal stories are usually read by people whose job depends on reading your work (see the video link at the end on the craft of writing effectively to which I credit this insight). Even if your writing is poor, your teachers will still read it and hopefully give you useful feedback. Why does this make you a victim? When people are judging you by your writing, and when they have the option to stop reading your writing they are in a far different position than your teachers. If your writing is confusing, redundant, hard to follow, etc. your readers will simply stop reading Having your writing discarded is devastating if your reader is a college admission officer, an employer, or a science funding agency. It's also something to remember when you are given instructions for an assignment (e.g. a format, font, word limit you are asked to follow). If you violate those rules you can usually guarantee it will be counted against you (I can't tell you how many time students have asked if they can exceed a word limit - don't!). These instructions are usually given by people who need to review 10's - 100's of essays/applications/etc. and they are looking for ways to reduce their workload (not to mention maintain impartiality and fairness towards those who did follow the rules). Don't be ashamed or feel insecure if your writing skills are poor at the moment. Writing is a skill, and can be learned and improved by practice. Practicing this skill is worth it. Good writing enables a scientist to succeed. Even if you don't plan on being a scientist, this advice will benefit you. How to become a good writer The best advice: the more you write, read other's writing, and (importantly) edit writing, the more natural good writing will be for you. Good writing skills are a long-term self-improvement project that's never too late to begin. I'll admit up front that this article cannot make you into a good writer. While you still need to get to that destination, no single step will take you there. Instead, I have assembled a few resources to help. I have also taken a perspective, the one taken by the book The Longman Guide to Revising Prose - we will focus on good editing skills rather than writing. Why focus on editing? I'll answer in two quotes (I hope the sources correct, but the ideas are valid) \"All writing is rewriting\" - John Green, Author \"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.\" Blaise Pascal, Philosopher/Mathematician You are smart, creative, and original. But like most human beings, it's more than likely that what you first write on the page is not the clearest expression of what you want to communicate. It is said that we often judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions. What that aphorism means in relation to writing is that we usually know what we mean to say when we write something down. What we have actually said is what our readers may interpret - which is usually full of differences we didn't expect. Although gap between author and reader sounds like a recipe for frustration, there are some easy ways to overcome most of the problems caused by this dilemma. The first and easiest solution is to put distance between yourself and your writing. Have you ever read something you wrote a few days or weeks ago and found things that were unclear or errors of some sort? By reading your writing after some time has past, you become a more objective reader, and can often find and fix mistakes. This is the best argument for making sure that you give yourself as much time as possible for writing assignments. Work out how much time (including days away from writing) needed to write a first, second, and perhaps even a third draft. Rushed, last-minute writing will almost certainly cost you. As you become a better writer you will also become a better editor of your own writing. The next thing suggestion for editing is to follow a method . The method suggested below will not correct every type of writing difficulty, but provides clear guidelines for revising writing. Paramedic Method Below are a handout and video that explains this method (which is detailed and elaborated on in the above mentioned Longman Guide book). I will not ask you memorize this method or demand that you always use it. I do hope that if you take a little time to understand it, you will apply in revision assignment below. This method has a few versions and I'll list a few steps at its core: Circle/highlight prepositions (of, in, to, etc.) - You will be looking to reduce or eliminate prepositions. Circle the \"is\" forms of verbs (where possible you will want to eliminate the verb to be) Circle the action (you will want to replace \"is/to be\" verbs with action verbs) Simplify actions and avoid compound verbs Start sentences fast - get to the point and avoid filler Read the writing aloud with feeling and correct sentences that sound awkward These 6 rules may sound a bit intimidating, but as I said you don't have to memorize them. Instead, watch this video that explains how this method works: The Paramedic Method [17 minutes] Paramedic method handout - this is unrelated to the specific video but has some nice examples This method is a first step to writing clear sentences. Besides clear sentence structure you must also think about how you develop logical arguments and how your voice makes it easy for the reader to understand your meaning. These edits go beyond sentence structure and we can cover them in a future assignment. The final step of improving writing is to actually have someone else read your writing. A good editor should return to you a document covered in red ink. Your obligation is put aside any pride and getting upset. Instead, you should be grateful for anyone who gives a critical assessment and strive to use suggestions to improve your result. Never take editing personally . Even the most skilled writers will always face the editor's pen. One more piece of advice Here are some rules by Orson Welles on writing well. They've stood the test of time: Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. (i.e avoid cliche) Never use a long word where a short one will do. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. Never use the passive where you can use the active. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent. (This rule will bend for science writing) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous. Assignment You were asked to write a short essay about the scientific method. Now you will be sharing that essay with a classmate. You will need to pair with one classmate and agree to edit their work. If there is an odd number, a group of three can be formed. Here is what to do depending on weather you are the author or the reviewer: Step Author Reviewer 1 Share your document with reviewer via. Google docs 2 Write your name at the top of the document to indicate you are the reviewer. Turn on the suggestion mode for Google docs Read through the document and do one of two things: 1) Leave comments on sentences or phrases you don't understand or which you think need improvement. You may want to ask specific questions of the author; 2) suggest changes or rewordings that you think would help When you have completed your review, let the author know you are done. 3 On a new page in the same document, rewrite the essay; DO NOT ACCEPT CHANGES SUGGESTED BY THE REVIEWER OR DELETE COMMENTS leave those so that I can see the review work that has been done In your new version, attempt to apply the paramedic method to improve your sentences 4 Beneath the revised essay, LIST and ANSWER the following questions: How many words is the revised essay, is it shorter? What were two example sentences that got better upon revision (write out the old and revised sentences) Beneath the revised essay, LIST and ANSWER the following question: Did the author address your concerns and is the revised essay better? How? 5 When you have completed the revision and questions, please email me that you have completed the assignment Two more videos worth watching, but for your own enrichment (you aren't responsible for watching them now): LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively Judy Swan, Scientific Writing: Beyond Tips and Tricks","title":"Writing Corner"},{"location":"Writing_Corner/01_Writing_Corner/#writing-corner","text":"","title":"Writing Corner"},{"location":"Writing_Corner/01_Writing_Corner/#scientists-are-writers","text":"Writing is the one thing you will never see a scientist doing on film or TV.

Include your results in your notes! How lab notebooks should be kept Lab notebooks aren't just a high school exercise. In every laboratory, there are lab notebooks and they are the most important record of your work. Note : A notebook is not your own. In a laboratory the notebook belongs to the PI (primary investigator), the person who runs the laboratory. A lab notebook is the authoritative record of how experiments were performed, and the data they generated. Here are some points to remember for our lab notebooks. Notebook entries should be neatly written in pen ( not pencil ). If needed, the notebook may also be typed. If an error is made, it should be neatly crossed out. The point is that there should be a permanent record that is unalterable. In cases of scientific fraud notebooks may be checked . Every page of the notebook (or every new entry) should have a date. We will also have a title for the various entries in our lab notebooks. There are usually two types of entries: Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not not necessarily do the experiment yourself. Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the experiment. In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way. Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your notebook.

In a laboratory the notebook belongs to the PI (primary investigator), the person who runs the laboratory. A lab notebook is the authoritative record of how experiments were performed, and the data they generated. Here are some points to remember for our lab notebooks. Notebook entries should be neatly written in pen ( not pencil ). If needed, the notebook may also be typed. If an error is made, it should be neatly crossed out. The point is that there should be a permanent record that is unalterable. In cases of scientific fraud notebooks may be checked . Every page of the notebook (or every new entry) should have a date. We will also have a title for the various entries in our lab notebooks. There are usually two types of entries: Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not not necessarily do the experiment yourself. Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the experiment. In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way. Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your notebook.","title":"How lab notebooks should be kept"},{"location":"lab_protocols/00_Introduction_to_protocols/#links-and-reading","text":"How to Start\u2013and Keep\u2013a Laboratory Notebook: Policy and Practical Guidelines","title":"Links and reading"},{"location":"lab_protocols/Mitocondrial_sequencing_at_home/","text":"Mitocondrial DNA Sequencing - DNA Extraction (at home) This is a protocol outline for obtaining DNA from cheek cells at home.

How do we calculate the molecular weight of a compound? How do we calculate molarity and why do we make use of moles? Why do we have stock solutions? How do we dilute a stock solution? Discussion outline Concentration One of the most basic laboratory reagents will involve some solute in some solvent. We have performed this procedure countless times, for example when we add some sugar to a cup of hot tea. To find the concentration, we need to know how much solvent (usually in grams) is dissolved in how much solvent (usually measured in liters). Dilution of stock solutions Commonly, we will create high-concentration solutions in the lab that can later be diluted. A high-concentration solution is called a 'stock' solution. Making a stock solution allows us to save space. For example, if we have a solution that has 100g of salt in 1L of water, we need a liter-sized bottle to store it. However, if we dissolve 100g of salt in 0.1L of water, we can store the same amount of solution in 1/10th the space. Question How does using a stock solution (vs. making a new solution every time it is needed) make science more reproducible? To dilute a solution from the original concentration to a new concentration we need to keep track of several things: The original concentration of the solution The desired final amount (volume) of the dilution we are making Desired final concentration of the dilution we are making The thing we need to figure out is what amount (volume) of the concentrated stock solution do we need to add to more solvent to make a more dilute solution. Again, keep in mind that this is an 'everyday' problem. Imagine you made some soup and accidentally added too much salt. You can't take the salt out, but you can add more water to make the final concentration of the salt less. The formula for calculating dilutions is: C 1 V 1 = C 2 V 2 Where: C 1 = The original/starting concentration of the stock solution V 1 = The (unknown) amount (volume) of the stock solution you will need to use C 2 = The final, desired concentration V 2 = The final, desired volume you wish to make Moles Probably one of the most important concepts in chemistry is the concept of a mole). The mole is a special number (it even has its own holiday). A mole is just a number, but a very large one: 6.02214078\u00d710 23 (A mole: also known as, Avagadro's Number) A 'mole' is actually shorthand for that large number. Just like a 'dozen' = 12, a couple = 2, etc. So why do we need this number? Well, Atoms are very small. We can't count them one by one, but when we have lots of atoms (several grams at least for the kinds of scales we have at school), we can measure and estimate how many atoms we have. Weighing atoms By definition, when we have a mole of atoms, we have 6.02214078\u00d710 23 atoms. In reality, just like not every egg will weigh 73g, different atoms have a diffent atomic mass. On the periodic table, the atomic mass is the number below the element symbol: For carbon (C), 12.011g of carbon, we have 6.02214078\u00d710 23 carbon atoms. A 1.008g sample of hydrogen (H) weighs much less but has the same number of atoms. Why this is very important With an understanding of Avagradro's number and the atomic masses from the periodic table, we can accomplish something amazing. When we combine elements to form a new compound (e.g. combining hydrogen and oxygen to make water), we know exactly how much (mass) of hydrogen we need to combine with how much oxygen so that we have enough amounts of each. Molar mass/moluar mass/fomula weight When we have a compound such as Glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) we calculate the molar mass as the sum of the total number of moles of each atom in the compound. C 6 H 12 O 6 6 Moles of Carbon 12 Moles of Hydrogen 6 Moles of Oxygen Molarity Related to moles is the concept of molarity, or how many moles of a substance do we have in a solution. The formula for molarity of is: Moles of solute/ Liters of solvent Limiting reagents Conceptually, knowing how many moles we have allows us to determine in advance how many moles of a substance is needed to create a particular molecule. For example: C 6 H 12 O 6 Would require us to have 6 moles of Carbon, 6 moles of Oxygen, and 12 moles of Hydrogen While we won't solve an example here, the sandwich example below gets the point across about limiting reagents - we can only make a much of a substance as the least abundant component will allow; If we have hundreds of slices of cheese, but only 2 slices of bread, we get only one sandwich.

Error table According to Eppendorf, pipettes should have the following amount of error (pipettes we used are highlighted) So for example, a blue pipette measuring 1000ul can will typically have up to 0.6 percent error. We can calculate this in the following cell: # 1000ul multiplied by 0.6% 1000 * 0.006 6.0 So, our measurement is usually off by about 6 microliters. This is the systemic error. If we also add the random error we get: # 1000ul multiplied by 0.6% + 0.2% 1000 * (0.006 + 0.002) 8.0 Including the random error we can be off by as much as 8 microliters.

Here are some questions to answer before reading further What is a \"method\"? What are some examples you can think of? What makes something \"scientific\"? What is the scientific method? Concept 01 - Methods are an approach to predictable results This may not sound particularly insightful, but starting from this general concept, we will explore it for now in a very specific context. Let's start with a tentative definition for the scientific method: The Scientific Method is the idea that questions about the natural world can by answered by following some set of steps to acquire knowledge and explain that knowledge in the form of a hypothesis . Philosophy and inquiry When we ask \"what something is?\" we are immediately in the realm of philosophy. Philosophy is a deep and wonderful area of human knowledge. It is not science, but for centuries it has explored important questions scientists would do well not to ignore Philosophy does Concept Clarification : One of the tasks of philosophy is to clarify what we mean when we say something. Take the phrase \"it's a beautiful day.\" What is beauty? What is the day? Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of questions, and questions of the form \"what is X?\" lead to entire fields of philosophical study (e.g. \"what is beauty\" is the subject of aesthetics; \"what is a part and what is a whole?\" is the subject of mereology). Philosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what we mean when we use those words. To get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy does? Here are four questions philosophy has worked on and that we can learn from: Philosophy asks What is knowledge? Epistemology - \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 * is a branch of philosophy that asks the question how can we know something? What is evidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse to trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important questions in the sciences. What is logical? Logic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae is a branch of philosophy which asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise (e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g. Socrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise to mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is not a science). How do we communicate our meaning? Philosophy of language asks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) to represent abstract concepts? In the English language for example, I can \" know that I have 3 dollars in my pocket\" and I can \" know how my friend thinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance languages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing someone you have relationship with (verb: conocer). Ultimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical conclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently scientific, but they are used by science. Philosophy of science is concerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in the sciences. Take home message : Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do its work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject. * Note : Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of Greek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every human culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to suggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the best one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its antecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw attention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to acknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these are the only possible ways to think about these terms. Key questions After that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to science? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's return to the one suggested above: The Scientific Method is the idea that questions about the natural world can by answered by following some set of steps to acquire knowledge about the world and explain that knowledge in the form of a hypothesis . Using this definition, and the one you posed in the What do you know questions, here are some additional ones to ask. Does the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano presented at a science fair scientific? What is the \"natural world\"? Besides the scientific method, what other methods do you think we might see used in science?

It is highly suggested that you give yourself time to write a first draft, reflect and/or get feedback, and write a final draft. Write a short essay on the following topic: The scientific method is a unique form of inquiry The point of your essay can be to support or refute the above statement; it's your choice which position to support.

A conclusion where you summarize your thoughts This is something more of an English assignment rather than a scientific writing assignment. You may have any opinion or position you want, but develop your ideas clearly and keep your writing simple.

Books What Is This Thing Called Science? - Alan F. Chalmers Amazon link Amazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars. Defending Science - within reason - Susan Haack Amazon link Amazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that, fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.","title":"Method"},{"location":"science_methodology_concepts/01_Method/#method","text":"","title":"Method"},{"location":"science_methodology_concepts/01_Method/#what-do-you-know","text":"Here are some questions to answer before reading further What is a \"method\"?
